![](http://aem.asm.org/content/76/8/2445/F4.large.jpg)

See the paper ["Use of Ichip for High-Throughput In Situ Cultivation of “Uncultivable” Microbial Species"](http://aem.asm.org/content/76/8/2445.full) for some background. 

## Materials 

+ black Delrin sheet, thickness 0.060" (=1.65 mm) ([buy from Interstate Plastics](https://goo.gl/AkfCP1)) 

## iChip design 

+ `delrin_array.cdr` is a CorelDraw file containing an array of 20 iChips for cutting on a laser cutter

## Laser cutting 

On our Kern instrument, we used the following settings: 

+ Precision/Short Optics Set
+ 2.8mm Focal offset
+ 45 PSI Air
+ Mounted to sacrificial cardboard

### Power settings

+ 1 inch/sec speed
+ 100% Power
+ 1000 Pulses Per Inch
+ -20 LSP (Laser Start Percent)
+ Offset of -10 mills for inside features, +10 mills for outline
